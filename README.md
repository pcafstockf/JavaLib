# JavaLib
General purposes tool bag of classes that I've personally used over the years.
Your mileage may vary :-)

As noted in the License.txt file...  
Files in this library are Copyright (c) 2014 Byte Lightning and published under the MIT License *UNLESS* otherwise noted in an individual package and/or file.  
NOTE that in some cases licenses and notices are found at the package level.

Some files were extracted from other open source libraries (such as Grizzly), 
magazine articles (such as DDJ), Stack Overflow, etc.

Because this is a general purpose tool bag, it depends on many different external libraries, which are all maven scoped as 'provided'.  
So if you use features of this library that depend on externals, you will need to pull them into your own application as appropriate.  
Of course feel free to just drop the source file(s) into your own application instead.
